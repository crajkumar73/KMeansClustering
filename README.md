# KMeansClustering

This topic branches into a new category of machine learning models, unsupervised ones. Students take first steps towards building autonomous learning systems, establishing a foundation for in-depth study into artificial intelligence in subsequent courses.
Objectives:

##### Construct a clustering model for unsupervised data analysis.
##### Detect anomalies in data in order to increase the precision of unsupervised learning models.
##### Implement a k-means model.
